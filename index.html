		<h1 id="title">My All time favorite Arsenal Players</h1>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2 id="explanation-heading">How this list came to be:</h2>
		<p class="description">This is a list of my favorite Arsenal players. Since I started following Arsenal in <strong>2008</strong>, this list contains only those players that I've seen play.
		   As you go through the list, you will realize that I like players associated with creativity more than others. Without wasting any time, let's jump right into it.</p>
		   
		<br>
		
		<ol reversed>
		
			<li>Samir Nasri:</li>
			<br>

			<br>
			
			<p class="description"> When I first heard about Arsenal in 2008 (or maybe 2009, I'm not sure), one of the first players I became familiar was Samir Nasri. He was having
				one of his best seasons in an Arsenal shirt, where he was assisting as well as scoring goals. His turtle neck style also made him stood out to me over other players.
				Besides the fact that he was really good for Arsenal, he was also one my creative players in FIFA 11 (lol!). Shame about the way he left though!</p>
				<br>
			
			<li>Mesut Ozil</li>

			<br>
			
			<p class="description">Ah Mesut Ozil! The player who divides opinion among fans and pundits. One thing no one can deny is his vision and passing ability. 
				He was one of the best No.10 (if not the best) in the world when Arsene Wenger signed him from Real Madrid. He had a decent first season where he provided
				a bunch of assists and helped Arsenal end the trophy drought. He truly came alive in the 2015/16 campaign where he provided 19 assists in the Premier League and 
				provided assits in 7 consecutive Premier League games (A record!). A general feeling around him is that Arsenal did not get the most out of him due to lack of 
				quality upfront during his time at Arsenal, though question marks were always raised about his work rate as well.</p>
				
				<br>
			
			
			<li>Aaron Ramsey</li>
			
			<img class="player-picture" src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp1954759.jpg" alt="Image of Aaron Ramsey" width="800">
			<br>
			
			<p class="description"> It was really tough to choose between No.1 and No.2 and unfortunately Aaron Ramsey comes second. He is the player whose style I like the most, 
			a box to box midfielder who can tackle, assist as well as score goals. I myself prefer to play as a No.8 so Aaron Ramsey was a huge influence for me. His standout season
			was obviously the 2013/14 campaign where he scored loads of goals, including the FA Cup final winner against Hull City. One of my favorite Aaron Ramsey goals was his goal
			against Norwich City at the Emirates. Check out the goal 
			<strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-pqkPGR6wU">here.</a></strong> My god Aaron Ramsey gives me so much nostalgia! The only reason why he comes at No.2 is
			because his contributions to the club while significant, might be slightly less than the No.1 choice. (Although Aaron Ramsey has helped 
			achieve more trophies than my No.1 choice so I understand any valid arguments) This brings us to the final player in the list:</p>
			
			<br>

			
			<li>Robin Van Persie</li>

			<p class="description">Although I started following Arsenal around 2008, it was in the 2011/12 season where I <em>really</em> became invested in the team!(Like Really).
			   The season started really bad with key departures of Fabregas and Nasri. Then came losses to Liverpool and <em>that</em> loss to Manchester United. It looked like 
			   this could be the worst ever season Arsenal will have in the Premier League. <br><br> But we still had Robin Van Persie <br></br>
			   
			   The flying Dutchman had his best ever season in an Arsenal shirt, scoring 30 goals in the Premier League as Arsenal bounced back from those heavy defeats to finish
			   3rd in the Premier League. His goals were of huge significance as well. I vividly remember his spectacular equalizer against Tottenham in the 5-2 win against them.
			   It was a joy to watch. He was the best player in the league at the time and he single-handedly (or should I say single-footedly) dragged Arsenal in the top 4 
			   of the league. It was a shame we didn't have great players to play with him because Arsenal surely could have achieved more if that was the case. Also, the way he
			   left and for the team he left still hurts, but that really showed how low Arsenal have fallen from its former heights. And truth be told, we havent been the same
			   ever since.

			   <p class="description"> That's it for this article, I plan to write some more stuff about Arsenal, football in general or anything else that I think about. 
			   Stay tuned!  </p>
